Two-dimensional Logical Relation type theory
by Robin Adams and Andrew Polonsky

This is an ongoing formalisation of a type theory with propositions, sets and gorupoids, with equality the canonical logical relation over the type.

See the files in the doc directory for an introduction to what we are trying to do.

Note: which type theory are we implementing?  The answer to that will be different each time you ask us.  We are experimenting and changing the rules of deduction all the time, as we find out what works and what does not.
